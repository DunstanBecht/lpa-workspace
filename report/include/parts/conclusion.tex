\section{Conclusions}

Within the framework of the tests carried out, several conclusions can be drawn from the synthesis in section \ref{sec:synthesis}

\begin{itemize}
\item For the distribution models \gls{rdd} and \gls{rrdd}, the asymptotic models \gls{guw2} and \gls{w2} give density results very close to the real densities.
\item It happens that the \gls{w1} model gives better predictions but never outside \gls{rrdd} or \gls{rcdde}.
\item In \gls{rrdd}, \gls{guw2} and \gls{w2} more often give good results than \gls{w1}.
\item For \gls{rcdde} and \gls{rcddr} no model is close to the actual density. But the asymptotic models are by far the closest.
\item For \gls{rcddd}, \gls{w1} is never close to the real density. \gls{guw2} and \gls{w2} give good results for small values of \( s \) \( t \) and \( l \) but the error increases when the latter variables increase.
\end{itemize}

Finally, \gls{guw2} and \gls{w2} models are often more accurate than the \gls{w1} model.
At least among the distributions tested, \gls{w1} should not be applied beyond the \gls{rrdd} hypotheses.
