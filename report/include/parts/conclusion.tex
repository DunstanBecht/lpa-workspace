\section{Conclusions}

Several conclusions can be drawn from the synthesis in section \ref{sec:synthesis}.

\begin{itemize}
\item The asymptotic models, \gls{guw2} and \gls{w2} are identical for the density prediction. They are very often more accurate than \gls{guw1} and \gls{w1} models.
\item The parameter \( s \sqrt{\gls{dst}} \) is very important for the determination of the error for both distribution \gls{rrdd} and \gls{rcdd}.
\item The parameter \( \gls{frrstp} \sqrt{\gls{dst}} \) is also important. It explains the way the models become incorrect at high densities when the value of \gls{frrstp} has a lower bound.
\item \gls{w1} should not be applied beyond the \gls{rrdd} hypotheses.
\end{itemize}
